# C-C
[NOT FINISHED] This project was supposed to recreate Command and Conquer in a web browser using canvas and js.
Not touched since 2016-10-04

- All objects are builded by "player" in his desired location
- Units and structures have predetermined cost (based on cost in original Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun)
- Structures will produce or consume power (power plant will produce power and everything else will consume it)
- Objects can be selected
 + Selected objects have "health bars" displayed above them
 + Selected Units can be ordered to move (by pressing "M" key and then pressing on a screen)
 + If multiple units where selected and ordered to move they will form grid based on their number
 + Moving units will face direction that they are currently moving
